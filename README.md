# QR-code-scanner
This repository contains a robust application that detects and decodes multiple QR codes from a live video stream or pre-recorded video. It extracts the embedded information from the QR codes and overlays it on the video in real-time. Additionally, the decoded information can be saved to a data file for further use or analysis.
